        <ul>IoT-based soil monitoring is a smart way to keep track of the health and condition of soil using modern technology.</ul>
        <ul>It uses small electronic devices called sensors, which are placed in the soil to collect important information like moisture levels (how wet or dry the soil is), temperature, and nutrient content.</ul>
        <ul> These sensors are connected to the internet, allowing them to send this data to a computer, smartphone, or cloud storage in real-time.</ul>

       <P>ðŸŒ¾ Introduction: AI Advisory in Crops and Farming
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the future of agriculture by enabling smart, data-driven decisions that increase productivity, reduce losses, and promote sustainable farming. AI advisory systems in crops and farming use machine learning, computer vision, and predictive analytics to assist farmers in managing their crops more effectively.
      By analyzing data from satellite imagery, weather patterns, soil sensors, and even smartphone photos, AI can provide real-time recommendations on crop health, disease risks, irrigation needs, pest control, and optimal harvesting times. These intelligent systems act like a virtual expertâ€”offering personalized advice to farmers based on local conditions, historical data, and scientific knowledge.
      From detecting leaf diseases with a smartphone to predicting a pest outbreak days in advance, AI advisory tools are becoming powerful allies for both smallholder farmers and large-scale agricultural operations. As access to mobile technology and internet connectivity improves, AI has the potential to democratize expert farming knowledge and boost food security around the world.
